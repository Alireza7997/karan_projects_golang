// Happy Numbers :
// A happy number is defined by the following process:
// Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits,
// and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
// Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers
// Display an example of your output here. Find first 8 happy numbers.
